### WellDone MoMo Mainboard Firmware

* This code should be compiled using Microchip's [XC16](http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en_us/devtools/mplabxc/) compiler for 16-bit PIC24 devices.
* It has been tested on version 1.11 of the compiler.
* The approved build-compile-test system is to use [Ceedling](http://throwtheswitch.org/).  An introduction to using ceedling for TDD in embeded PIC environments can be found [HERE](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/10/22/getting-started-with-tdd-for-microchips-pics/)
* Unit and functional test scaffolding is forthcoming - we expect to support both the Microchip PIC Simulator and in-device physical test definitions.
