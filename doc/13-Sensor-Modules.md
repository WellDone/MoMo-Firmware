## Sensor Modules

Sensor Modules collect information from the physical world around a MoMo.

### MultiSensor

This is the Hulk Hogan of sensor boards.  It can serve many different purposes, and contains circuitry for the following sensors:

- 1 pulse counter
- 3 voltage sensors
- 1 current sensor
- 1 pressure sensor (requires an additional pressure transducer IC component)
- 1 serial comm line

More information about the MultiSensor and how to use it coming soon.
