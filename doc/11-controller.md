## The Controller

This is the brain of any MoMo unit, and is the only module that is absolutely required.  The controller module contains:
- A 16-bit PIC24 MCU.
- 1MB of Flash memory
- A battery connector (which expects 2.8-3.4V DC)
- A battery charging circuit (the charging port expects >100mA from a solar panel or USB charger)

Version 5 of the controller hardware, currently the top of the line, is pictured below.

In this picture, the white connector on the left is for the battery and the port on the right is (optionally) for the charging source.
